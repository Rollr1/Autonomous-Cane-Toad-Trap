# Autonomous-Cane-Toad-Trap
In Southwest Florida, Cane Toads run rampant eating local wildlife and killing pets due to their potent poison. Therefore, I designed and built a prototype autonomous vision trap meant to lure the toad in, move it into a removable container, and be able to differentiate between cane toads and other creatures.
