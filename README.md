# Autonomous-Cane-Toad-Trap
In Southwest Florida, Cane Toads run rampant eating local wildlife and killing pets due to their potent poison. Therefore, I designed and built a prototype autonomous vision trap meant to lure the toad in, move it into a removable container, and be able to differentiate between cane toads and other creatures using a vision sensor. (High School Senior Science Fair)


Tech/Material Stack:
-Python
-VEX V5 Brain
-VEX V5 motors
-VEX V5 Vision Sensor
-VEX metal parts
-Magnet worklight

What I learned:
Research process, defining a real-world problem (invasive toads), breaking that problem down into smaller pieces (baiting the toad, capturing the toad, capturing more than one toad, waterproofing the trap, lighting up the trap during nighttime, moving the toad from main trap to the removable container). Designing the trap on paper then through 3D modeling (Fusion 360), and in real life. Once the trap was built, I had to actually test if it would work. Unfortunately, I couldn't test the trap on live Cane Toads due to the rules of the science fair, so I used a replica of a Cane Toad.


The final research trifold poster is shown in toad-poster.pdf, and the CAD and other relevant photos including details of each specific part are in trap-photos.pdf
